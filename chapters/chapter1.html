B. Beaverton was outside during the nicest day ever. The birds were singing. The sun was bright and warm. And B. Beaverton had just come back from a big business trip, so a nice day was just what he needed.

The mailman had just driven by his street, reminding Beaverton that he should check his mail since he hadn’t while he was gone on his trip. 

Gadzooks! Beaverton opened his mailbox and it was overflowing with mail. Big letters, small letters, advertisements, newspapers. Bills, postcards, every sort of mail. So much mail that he couldn’t catch it all and some of it dropped on the ground.

Beaverton needed to go inside to get a basket for it all. He grabbed a large, brown, woven basket so as to be sure that all of it could fit. With his basket in hand, Beaverton went back towards the mess of mail. 

Clearing up all the letters took quite a while, the wind had blown the mail apart. But eventually Beaverton had gathered everything that had fallen. There were just a few more things still in the mailbox but that was much easier to get.

Beaverton thought to place the basket underneath the mailbox and scoop out the mail into it. Soon the mail was all in the basket, except for one small letter still in the mailbox. It was a very odd shape. It was a round letter!

B. Beaverton was very surprised, he had never seen a round letter. This must be a special letter! A special letter that should be opened since it probably has something special inside too, Beaverton thought.

As Beaverton picked it up and looked at it, he saw that it was torn and ripped. Only a little of the letter remained, most of it was missing! The envelope had “To B. Beave” written on it. B. Beaverton didn’t know anyone with the last name Beave.

But Beaverton was still very curious and so looked at what was in the envelope and found a small piece of paper. It read “Grandma’s Famous B……. P……. Serves 12”. The B and P were next to the edge of the paper so the rest of the words must have been ripped off. What could this be? Beaverton was stumped. He didn’t know.

Beaverton thought long and hard and decided he should ask someone else. After all if it was Grandma’s famous something or other, then other people must know about it. His good friend Oliver the Owl. Oliver was very smart and would probably know what this was. Oliver lived a few houses down in a small red house. Beaverton trotted over.

*Knock knock* Beaverton knocked on the door. Oliver was an older owl and so sometimes couldn’t hear very well. Beaverton knocked louder. *Knock knock* Not a second later the door opened. “Oh hello Beaverton!” It was Oliver with his morning coffee.

“Hi Oliver. I have a question to ask you!”

“Oh what’s that?”

“Well,” said Beaverton. “I got this letter in the mail, but it’s torn apart and I don’t know what it is.”

“Oh? Very curious, let me take a look at it.” *Reads* “Hmmmm, well it looks like to me, that you have part of a Recipe! 

"A recipe! I wonder what food it's for?"

"Well it looks like it has a word that starts with a B and another that starts with a P."

"Hmmm, B and P. Well the B could be bologna and the P could be peas. So bologna and peas?"

"Ho ho, I don't think so," said Oliver. "But my neighbor Glenda loves food, and might know what it is!"

"Well let's ask her then!"

So Beaverton and Oliver hopped on over to Glenda the Gator's house. Glenda was just next door in a dark green, flat and long house which had ivy growing everywhere.

Oliver knocked softly. "Glenda are you home?"

There was no response.

Oliver knocked again. "We have a food mystery on our hands and need your help!"

Before you could say Pass the peas please, Glenda made a ruckus of a sound banging over pots and dropping spoons before opening the door.

"Whaa!? A foo mythery, Oyiver?! Yell me ereryhing!” Glenda was trying to talk with a mouthful of food.

"Well," Beaverton began. "I was checking my mail this morning and found this torn letter inside my mailbox."

Before Beaverton could explain any further Glenda grabbed the letter and read what was inside: Grandma's Famous B… P… Serves 12.

Now the one thing you must know about Glenda is that Glenda loves eating food. But Glenda doesn't know a lot about making food.

Glenda tried to think about it anyways, this time without a mouthful of food. "This is a letter! Not food? I thought you had a mystery about food?"

Oliver spoke up, "Well it IS about food, the letter has a recipe in it, but the name of the recipe is torn off!"

“Oh?” Said Glenda.

“Yes, and we are hoping you might have an idea of what it could be for. Some food with the initials B. P.” piped up Beaverton.

“I have no idea, but I am munching on some peanuts, would you like some?” Glenda stepped behind the door and came back with a jar of peanuts. The label read Riley’s Blanched Peanuts.

“Wait, maybe it could be a recipe for Blanched Peanuts!” Beaverton exclaimed.

“Oh yes!” said Glenda. “That’s exactly what I was thinking! I knew it all along!”
